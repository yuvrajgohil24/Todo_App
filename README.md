# Todo App (Vite+React) 
Link: https://assignment-todosapp.netlify.app/

=> In this app I fetch the data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos.

=> For styling and prebuilt components I used Material-UI.

=> In that application we have two sections:
-In left section I provide the list of individual data by showing the data titles
-In the right section you can modify the selected data by changing its status from "incomplete" to "complete" and you can delete that data from the list too.

=> I use Infinite Scroller for replacing the basic Pagination.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
